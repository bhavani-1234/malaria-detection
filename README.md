To address the flaws, the following new system has been developed. Using computer vision and image-based deep learning techniques,we were able to develop an analytical tool for assessing patients' thin blood smear pictures, which are useful in determining illness

CNN image classification takes a thin blood smear picture as input, analyses it, and then categorizes it. The computer treats a thin blood smear image as an array of pixels, with the number of pixels varying depending on the image resolution.The activation function is placed before the convolution blocks in the proposed technique.Then, at the conclusion of each convolution layer, max pooling is performed.As a sample-based discretization method, max-pooling was applied
